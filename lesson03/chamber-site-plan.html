            <h3>Site Name - South Lyon Chamber of Commerce</h3>
            <!--This is the name of the site normally based upon the locale and purpose. 
                A representative domain that is available to purchase would be normally 
                important but not required in this class. Provide a valid site name that 
                is relevant to the locale. Include the word "Chamber" in the site name 
                and a short reason why the the site name was selected.-->
            <p>The reason I choose this site name and city, it is because I currently reside in the City of South Lyon in Michigan.
                It is a small but growing community. 
            </p>           
            <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
            <!--The South Lyon Chamber of Commerce 
                Site Purpose: The site purpose should attempt to provide scope to the website 
                content in describing what services and information will be provided. The client 
                typically drives this content by stating functional specifications. It is OK to 
                be less formal than this given example. Provide at least two purposes for having
                the website developed and running.
                Example: "The Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce acts as a regional economic catalyst, 
                leadership convener and community champion. We promote business through member 
                services, economic and community development, and public policy that balances 
                economic prosperity" - carlsbad.org site description-->
            <p>South Lyon Chamber of Commerce main purpose is to work and server together with local 
                businesses. The main goal of this chamber is to promote the economic growth of it's members
                through member services, and engaging in activites that improves both businesses and the 
                community. 
            </p>
            <h3>Scenarios</h3>
            <!--Scenarios are questions that are asked by a site visitor who represents the target audience 
                of the organization or company. The questions will drive the content of the website as it 
                provides answers to the questions. Again, much of the content specifications will actually 
                be provided but start thinking about the target audience of a chamber of commerce site. 
                Visit real chamber of commerce sites. Include at least three scenarios.
                Examples
                • What events will the chamber be holding this month that promote business-to-business networking?
                • Where can I find contact information for the chamber's board of directors?
                • What has been the population growth in the area?-->
            <ol>
                <li>What activity is the Chamber of Commerce currently working on to promote it's mission?
                </li>   
            <!--<p>During this summer season, the Chamber organizes a farmer's market every Saturday from May to October. 
                This activity brings many local vendors together that might not have a brick and mortar presence. 
                However, it helps bring foot traffic to Downtown South Lyon where some of it's members are located.
                Also, the Chamber of Commerce has a monthly booth to promote membership and it's activites. The are other
                planned activites during the calendar year.
            </p>-->
                <li>What has been the economic impact of the Chamber of Commerce to it's members?
                </li>
            <!--<p>We do not have an exact number as it varies from business to business. However, most members see
                benefits by offering their services to other members and commonly receiving a reduce price. The 
                chamber also offers marketing opportunities, business coaching and more.  
            </p>-->
                <li>How often board members meet for planning and provide status of their internal affairs? 
                </li>
            <!--<p>Every three months, the chamber conducts a board member meeting to talk about
                upcoming activites, plan of future activities, and provide an overall status of its financial 
                situation, membership numbers and more. 
            </p>-->
                <li>What are the requirements to become a member?
                </li>
            <!--<p>The requirements to become a member are to have a registered business. This business can be registered
                outside of Oakland County, but they should have a presence in the city of South Lyon by demonstrating 
                they are conduting business in the city, etc.

                and show where each color selected will be used, such as headings, paragraphs, background colors, 
                accents, and so on.-->

            <!--The typography section of the planning document provides examples of the fonts to be used and 
                where they are to be applied. No less than one font and no more than three fonts selections need 
                to be selected. Indicate where each selected font will be used (such as headings, body, and 
                so on). Other fonts can be used for special circumstances or sections as needed. When choosing
                web fonts, consider factors such as readability, compatibility, and the overall aesthetic of your 
                website. Additionally, always check the licensing terms of the fonts you plan to use to ensure 
                they align with your project's requirements.
