            <h3>Site Name</h3>
            <p>This is the name of the site normally based upon the locale and purpose. 
                A representative domain that is available to purchase would be normally 
                important but not required in this class. Provide a valid site name that 
                is relevant to the locale. Include the word "Chamber" in the site name 
                and a short reason why the the site name was selected.</p>

            <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
            <p>Site Purpose: The site purpose should attempt to provide scope to the website content in describing what services and information will be provided. The client typically drives this content by stating functional specifications. It is OK to be less formal than this given example. Provide at least two purposes for having the website developed and running.
                Example: "The Carlsbad Chamber of Commerce acts as a regional economic catalyst, leadership convener and community champion. We promote business through member services, economic and community development, and public policy that balances economic prosperity" - carlsbad.org site description

        <section>
            <h3>Scenarios</h3>
            <p>Scenarios are questions that are asked by a site visitor who represents the target audience of the organization or company. The questions will drive the content of the website as it provides answers to the questions. Again, much of the content specifications will actually be provided but start thinking about the target audience of a chamber of commerce site. Visit real chamber of commerce sites. Include at least three scenarios.
                Examples
                â€¢ What events will the chamber be holding this month that promote business-to-business networking?
                â€¢ Where can I find contact information for the chamber's board of directors?
                â€¢ What has been the population growth in the area?

            <h3>Color Schema</h3>
            <p>The color schema refers to the carefully selected site colors that reflect the organization's 
                purpose and trademark. The planning document defines the color scheme through a color palette 
                that labels color style definitions and swatches for site elements. Define at least two colors 
                and show where each color selected will be used, such as headings, paragraphs, background colors, 
                accents, and so on.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <p>The typography section of the planning document provides examples of the fonts to be used and where they are to be applied. No less than one font and no more than three fonts selections need to be selected. Indicate where each selected font will be used (such as headings, body, and so on). Other fonts can be used for special circumstances or sections as needed. When choosing web fonts, consider factors such as readability, compatibility, and the overall aesthetic of your website. Additionally, always check the licensing terms of the fonts you plan to use to ensure they align with your project's requirements.

                <h3>Wireframe</h3>
                <p>Wireframe: Provide a rough sketch of the design of the chamber home page layout. Wireframe diagrams can be simple and do not need to have actual content, just representations of content and their layout relationship. Provide a sketch for the mobile view and for an larger, such as desktop, view for the home page.
