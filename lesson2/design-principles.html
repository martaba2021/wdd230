        Content: 3 principles with examples:
        Visual Hierarchy: Visme
        Rule of Thirds: Tesla
        White space and Clean Design: Google

        For each example:
        For each of the principles that you selected you will need to provide (see screenshot examples below):
        the design principle,
        the organization/company's name,
        the web site address as a external hyperlink,
        a mobile view screenshot of an organization's web page that, in your opinion, illustrates that principle, and
        a brief description on how the design principle is exemplified on that page.

        <p>As you may already know, the principle of "Visual Hierarchy" means that we must arrange page elements to 
        show their order of importance. This can be accomplished with pictures, colors, font sizes, etc. which guides 
        the audience to our desired content.</p>
        <p>In visme, you can see the principle of <bold>"Visual Hierarchy"</bold> applied through their page design.
        This is important as it draws their audience attention to the most relevant information of their company in seconds.
        At the top of their main page, visme accomplished this design principle with both the size and color of their font. 
        They have also use dark colors with a bright background providing even more contrast directing their audience.

        <h2>Tesla</h2>

        <img src="images/Tesla.png" alt="screenshot of tesla on mobile device">
        </section>
        <p>Another important design principle is the "Rules of Thirds", which has been around for centuries as it is simple but 
        yet powerful. The "Rule of Thirds" simply  requires to divide a frame in nine equal parts and place your elements on 
        either intersections or lines.
        </p>
        <p>If you visit tesla's main page, you can see this principle being applied through their video that is located at the top. 
        The cars are place strategically in these video frames creating a great visual effect and guiding their visitors to the user 
        experience they are trying to sale.

        <h2><u>White Space and Clean Design</u></h2>
        <h2>Google</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">"Google.com"</a></h3>
        <img src="images/Google.png" alt="screenshot of google on mobile device">
        <p>Design principles offer a variety of options and "White Spane and Clean Design" is another choice that has been proven
        successful through time. In this principle, we learn that we do not need to clutter our pages and less is more.</p>
        <p>Google is a great example at utilizing this principle, as you visit google main page notice all the white space. They have
        have been one of the top's search engines in the industry for years. They were not afraid at utilizing this clean desing and 
        lots of white space.
